        WHAT IS SPATIAL DESIGN?
      </h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        We all have heard many interior designers talking about the
        functionality of a space. But have we ever studied how people use
        spaces? Have we ever gone in the depths of studying peoplesâ€™ daily
        activities and flow patterns?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        The whole idea is to keep people at the heart of design. Being able to
        design interactions among people, between people and natural elements
        like sunlight and wind, between people and objects and in the end
        creating a relationship between people, architecture, landscape and
        interior.

        WHAT IS AVSDS ALL ABOUT?
      </h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        For us, it is vital to understand each end userâ€™s circulation patterns
        in their private space as well as the shared spaces. We believe in
        thoughtfully designing each space, nook and wall, which in turn helps us
        delivery value to any space. This ensures a positive influence on the
        clientâ€™s day to day life. Other than this, it is also important to
        understand how their needs and wants can evolve in the future, ensuring
        us to design a space that can beÂ accommodative.

        OUR PRINCIPLES
      </h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph} ${styles.mobilePrinciplePara}`}>
        Our design principles are rooted in the belief that spaces should be not
        merely functional but also evocative, reflecting the unique personality
        and aspirations of our clients, where every line, curve, and texture
        tells a story of opulence and refinement, transforming houses into homes
        that are not just aesthetically pleasing but also emotionally resonant
        and functionally efficient.

        OUR PHILOSOPHY
      </h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        All the above will be done with the help the family members the space is
        intended for. Yes, all clients want to be involved in the design
        process, and we designers hesitate to give them the reins. But at AVSDS,
        we ensure that the role played by the client is of the highest value,
        allowing them to open themselves to us by sharing their desires, wants
        and needs and not just their requirements.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        The same will not be done through an interview or endless meetings, but
        in informal settings like cafes, art and clay workshops, galleries, the
        end userâ€™s current home and so on. This will ensure that we understand
        their personality, their way of living, their lifestyle, their likes and
        dislikes and so much more rather than just understanding their
        requirements and what pleases them aesthetically, which leads to
        designing their homes as a standard market practice.
